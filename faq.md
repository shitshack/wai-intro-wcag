<h2 id="done">Is WCAG 2 stable?</h2>
<p>Yes. WCAG standards (called &quot;W3C Recommendations&quot;) are a stable, referenceable standards that do not change. There may be later versions published.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 {% include_cached different.html %}</a> was published as a final W3C Recommendation Web Standard on 11 December 2008. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1 {% include_cached different.html %}</a> was published as a final W3C Recommendation Web Standard on 5 June 2018. <strong>They will not change.</strong></p>
<p>The supporting resources &mdash; Techniques for WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2 &mdash; are updated periodically to reflect updates in technologies and best practices.</p>
<p><em>See also important information in the next answer about WCAG 2.1:</em></p>

<h2 id="v21">What about WCAG 2.1?</h2>

All requirements ("success criteria") from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1.

The primary focus for WCAG 2.1 is additional accessibility requirements for:
* [mobile accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/mobile/#intro)
* people with low vision,
* people with cognitive and learning disabilities

There are 17 additional success criteria in 2.1 that are not in 2.0. They are introduced in [What's New in WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/).

**Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0**. (This is often called “backwards compatible”.) A website that meets WCAG 2.1 should meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0.

To put it another way: If you want to meet both WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, you can use the 2.1 resources and you don't need to bother looking at 2.0.

WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are both existing standards. WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG when developing or updating content or accessibility policies.

<h2 id="next">What's next after WCAG 2.1?</h2>
<p>The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is also exploring future accessibility guidelines through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/">Silver Task Force</a>. Additional information is available in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YjaxD3qNAUV0dcx485AyEpq5RY_WpXgFk27TozDbPM8/edit#slide=id.p">Silver presentation {% include_cached external.html %}</a>. This project will take several years.</p>
<p>In the interim, the Working Group might decide to develop WCAG 2.2 to provide additional updates to address current accessibility requirements.</p>

<h2 id="mobile">Does WCAG 2 address mobile accessibility?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/mobile/">Mobile Accessibility at W3C</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="vpat21">Does VPAT 2.1 include WCAG 2.1?</h2>
<p>No. Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) 2.1 includes information from WCAG 2.0. VPAT 2.1 does not include information from WCAG 2.1. (VPAT is not developed by W3C.)</p>
  
<h2 id="start">Where should I start?</h2>
<p class="listintro">If you want a really short introduction to 3 web accessibility issues (alternative text for images, keyboard input, and transcripts), see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#examples">Examples of Web Accessibility</a>.</p>
<p class="listintro">To learn about web accessibility principles and guidelines, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/">Accessibility Principles</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To learn about WCAG 2 specifically, start with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG Overview</a>.</strong> It provides an important foundation for understanding the different WCAG 2 documents, and points to several resources for using WCAG 2.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/">How to Meet WCAG 2: A customizable quick reference {% include_cached different.html %}</a> is the primary resource for developers using WCAG 2.</p>

<h2 id="docs">What are the different WCAG 2 documents?</h2>
<p>To learn how the different WCAG 2 technical documents are related and linked, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20">The WCAG 2 Documents</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a little more perspective on the different technical documents. When web content and web software developers were using WCAG <em><strong>1.0</strong></em>, they had many questions on how to implement it, how to evaluate for it, and the reasons behind its requirements. WAI wanted to provide this information with WCAG 2, and since those details don't fit well in a technical standard, they are in the supporting documents.</p>
<p>Thus with WCAG 2, there are extensive supporting materials, which are advisory documents. The WCAG 2 guidelines document  itself is the only document that is a web standard, and it is fairly short.</p>

<h2 id="techs">Do content authors (developers, designers, etc.) have to follow W3C's techniques to meet WCAG?</h2>
<p><strong>No</strong>, you do not have to use the techniques in W3C's <cite>Techniques for WCAG 2</cite> document.</p>
<p>The techniques are informative; that means they are not required. The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the success criteria from the WCAG 2 standard — not the techniques.</p>
<p>While many authors find W3C-documented techniques useful, there may be other ways to meet WCAG success criteria. You can use other techniques. Web content could even fail a particular technique test, yet still meet WCAG in a different way. Also, content that uses some of the  Techniques does not necessarily meet all WCAG success criteria.</p>
<p><strong>For important additional information, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/understanding-techniques.html">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria section {% include_cached different.html %}</a> of Understanding WCAG 2.1</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="techsnot">What would be the negative consequences of allowing <em>only</em> W3C's published techniques to be used for conformance to WCAG 2?</h2>
<p>Background:  Some organizations have considered requiring all web content to use  W3C's published techniques.</p>
<p><strong>W3C recommends that the only thing that is required is meeting the WCAG 2 success criteria. </strong>The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the success criteria from the WCAG 2 standard — not the techniques. <span class="prefix">W3C's <cite>Techniques for WCAG 2</cite> document is informative (that is, not required, non-normative).</span></p>
<p><strong>W3C cautions against requiring  web content to use only W3C's published sufficient techniques and not allowing other techniques</strong> for several reasons, including:</p>
<ul class="listspaced">
  <li><strong>It would prevent the use of  new technologies (for example, HTML5 and WAI-ARIA) while the technologies and relevant sufficient techniques are being developed, which is usually more than a year.<br>
    </strong> It often takes several years for technologies to be developed and finalized. Once a technology is stable, it usually takes several months for the WCAG Working Group to  develop techniques, test them with user agents and assistive technologies, make them available for public review, revise them as needed, and formally publish them.</li>
  <li>W3C's <em><cite>Techniques for WCAG 2</cite></em> is not comprehensive and may not cover newer technologies and situations.  There may be techniques that are sufficient to meet a given success criteria, but that are not yet included in W3C's published document.</li>
  <li>W3C's published sufficient techniques may not always be the best techniques in a specific circumstance.</li>
  <li>It is not always possible to use the W3C's published sufficient techniques — for example, because of the way the content is designed — and there are other ways to meet the success criteria.</li>
  <li>It would prevent the use of new techniques and best practices until W3C published them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Therefore, W3C's published techniques should not be required as the only way to meet WCAG 2 success criteria  unless the  limitations and consequences above are understood and acceptable.</strong></p>
<p>For additional information, see: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/understanding-techniques.html">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria {% include_cached different.html %}</a> section of Understanding WCAG 2.1.</p>

<h2 id="iso">Is ISO/IEC 40500 the same as WCAG 2.0?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> WCAG 2.0 is  approved as an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2012. ISO/IEC 40500 is exactly the same as the original Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C {% include_cached different.html %}</a> Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">WAI</a>).</p>
<p>The content of ISO/IEC 40500 is freely available from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20</a>;  it is available for purchase from the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=58625">ISO catalogue {% include_cached external.html %}</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For supporting resources that provide practical advice for meeting ISO/IEC 40500 (which is WCAG 2.0), see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">WCAG Overview</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The approval was announced 15 October 2012 in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/07/wcag2pas-pr.html">press release {% include_cached different.html %}</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2012/10/wcag_20_is_now_also_isoiec_405.html">blog post {% include_cached different.html %}</a>.

<h3>Benefits of WCAG as ISO</h3>
<p>Approval of WCAG 2.0 as an ISO standard benefits countries and organizations that can more easily  adopt ISO standards. Countries that previously adapted WCAG 2.0 may now be able to <em>adopt WCAG 2.0 as is</em> by referencing  ISO/IEC 40500.</p>

<h3 id="isotranslations">Translations</h3>
<p>W3C has offered our <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/translations.html">WCAG 2.0 Authorized Translations</a> to be used for the ISO/IEC translations. We will update this page when more information about translations is available.</p>

<h2 id="languages">Is WCAG 2 available in other languages?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Authorized Translations and unofficial translations of the technical documents WCAG 2, Techniques for WCAG 2, and Understanding WCAG 2 are listed in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/translations.html">WCAG 2 Translations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="othertechs">Can I meet WCAG 2 with Javascript/Ajax, Silverlight, and other technologies?</h2>
<p>WCAG 2 is designed to apply to a broad range of web technologies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2 {% include_cached different.html %}</a> has  techniques for several different web technologies. <em>Note that publication of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all cases to create accessible content that meets WCAG 2.</em> Developers need to be aware of the limitations of specific technologies and ensure that they create content in a way that is accessible to all their potential users. 
</p>
<p>WAI is also developing guidance on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/">Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT) {% include_cached different.html %}</a>.</p>
