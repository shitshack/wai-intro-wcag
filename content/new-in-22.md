description: This page lists the new success criteria in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. It includes quotes from personas (fictional people) to help you understand some aspects of the success criteria.

teaser_text: WCAG 2.2 has 9 additional requirements (“success criteria”) that address the needs of people with cognitive or learning disabilities, mobile devices users, and ebook users. The What’s New in WCAG 2.2 page introduces the new success criteria. It includes quotes from personas to help you understand the issues.

This page lists the **proposed** new success criteria for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.

**It includes quotes from personas (fictional people)** to help you understand some aspects of the success criteria. It also includes links to Understanding documents that explain the success criteria in detail and provide more examples.

## Introduction, Timeline, Changes

For an introduction to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and more about versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, see the [WCAG Overview](/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

WCAG 2.2 is scheduled to be completed and published in early 2023. Current versions:
* [WCAG 2.2 W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) was approved for publication in September 2022
* [Editors' Draft of WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/) may include more recent proposed changes that are not yet all approved

The main purpose of "Candidate Recommendation" is to ensure that the standard can be implemented. It is stable at this stage; however, it could change based on implementation experience. Specifically, 2.4.11 Focus Appearance is "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#items-at-risk">at risk</a>" and might not be included in the final publication.

More about Candidate Recommendation and the process for completing WCAG 2.2 is introduced in [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/).

### Implementations and Comments

In November 2022, we are processing implementations and comments from the Candidate Recommendation publication. We are looking for additional implementations of [2.5.7 Dragging Movements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/#257-dragging-movements-aa). You can share your implementations by logging into [your W3C account](https://www.w3.org/Help/Account/) and using the [WCAG Implementation Information Form](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG22/CR/select_site). Please also send e-mail to the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group Co-Chairs and W3C staff at: group-ag-chairs@w3.org

We hope that the normative content in WCAG 2.2 itself does not need changes. We will continue to update the Understanding documents based on feedback. To comment, please open a [new issue in the WCAG GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/new). Create separate GitHub issues for each topic, rather than commenting on multiple topics in a single issue. If it’s not feasible for you to use GitHub, send comments in e-mail to: public-agwg-comments@w3.org

### Changes from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 2.2

All success criteria from 2.0 and 2.1 are included in 2.2. The 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.2. **One changed level: [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible)** is changed from Level AA in WCAG 2.1 to Level A in WCAG 2.2.

The WCAG 2.2 Draft provides 9 additional success criteria from WCAG 2.1. They are included on this page.

### Changes to the 2.2 Draft

Changes from the May 2021 Working Draft to the September 2022 Candidate Recommendation Draft include:
* Added "Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA)" and "Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced) (AAA)".
* Updated "Focus Appearance (AA)" and removed “Focus Appearance (Enhanced) (AAA)”.
* After "Accessible Authentication (AA)", added "Accessible Authentication (No Exception) (AAA)"
* Removed "Visible Controls" (because we did not get agreement on what the visual indicator would need to be). We plan to add this to [Supplemental Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/).
* Removed "Page Break Navigation" (because we did not get agreement on the level of granularity required for the page-break markers). We plan to add this to [Supplemental Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/).

Previous changes are listed in the [changelog](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#changelog).

## Guideline 2.4 Navigable

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

  <p class="note">Note: Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu, or focusable cells in a grid.</p>
  <p class="note">Note: Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the technology (such as HTML, CSS and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.</p>

The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across pages for the same page variation (e.g., CSS break-point). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the page's zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different page variation. This criterion is concerned with relative order across pages displayed in the same page variation (e.g., same zoom level and orientation).</p>

## About the Personas Quotes

The linked persona roles go to the [[Stories of Web Users]](/people-use-web/user-stories/). That page has other personas with different disabilities. We might add more in the future.

We plan to add persona quotes to the Understanding WCAG documents.
