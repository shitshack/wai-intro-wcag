This page describes the different Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 technical documents. It helps you know where to go for which type of information.

For background and an introduction to WCAG, see [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php).

## Different documents for different purposes

![diagram of documents described in the text]({{ "/content-images/wai-intro-wcag/wcag20docs.png" | relative_url }})<br>Figure 1: WCAG 2.0 documents. WCAG 2.1 has the same documents.

### WCAG 2 Standard

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is
designed to be a stable, referenceable technical standard. Most people
will use the supporting documents when developing web content and web
tools, instead of the actual technical standards document.

### How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)

[How to Meet WCAG 2: A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2
requirements (Success Criteria) and
techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) is a **key resource
for designers and developers using WCAG 2. It includes all the WCAG
2 guidelines and success criteria**. It is essentially the [WCAG 2
checklist](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).

The success criteria are the testable statements that define how web
content meets (conforms to) WCAG 2. Under each success criteria are a
list of sufficient techniques; that is, if you implement those
techniques you meet the success criteria. It also lists common failures,
that is, things that do not meet the guidelines.

You can customize <cite>How to Meet WCAG 2</cite> to show what you are interested in at the time. There are "filters" for different roles, topics, and technologies (such as HTML, CSS, ARIA). You can also select to show [Level A, AA, or AAA success criteria](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head).

### Understanding WCAG 2

**"Understanding WCAG 2: A guide to understanding and implementing Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2"** ([2.1 Understanding]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/), [2.0 Understanding](/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/))
has additional details for people who want to understand the guidelines
and success criteria more thoroughly. It provide extensive guidance,
including the intent of the guideline or success criterion; how it helps
people with different disabilities, browser and assistive technology
support notes, examples, and resources, such as [tools to check color
contrast]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#visual-audio-contrast-contrast-resources-head).

### Techniques for WCAG 2

**"Techniques for WCAG 2: Techniques and Failures for Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2"** ([2.1 Techniques]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/), [2.0 Techniques](/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/)) gives specific
guidance for developers on how to develop accessible web content. It
provides general and technology-specific examples, including for
HTML/XHTML, CSS, scripting, multimedia, and
[WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria). There are also common
failures that show what to avoid.

## Getting from one document to the other

The WCAG 2 documents are interlinked. For example:

-   In WCAG 2,
    -   Links such as "How to Meet 1.1.1" go to the **How to Meet WCAG
        2** document, and jumps down to that section within the
        document.
    -   Links such as "Understanding 1.1.1" links go to an
        **Understanding WCAG 2** topic page.
        -   You can get to the [Contents list of all the Understanding 
            topics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/#understanding-pages)
            from the \[Contents\] button at the top.
        -   You can get all the topics in one large web page from the
            "single HTML version" link in the footer of each topic page.
-   In both How to Meet WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2, there are
    lists of techniques that are links. These links go to a **Techniques
    for WCAG 2** topic page.
    -   You can get to the [Contents list of all the Techniques
        topics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/#techniques) from the
        \[Contents\] button at the top.
    -   You can get all the topics in one large web page from the
        "single HTML version" link in the footer of each topic page.
